This code is very incomplete, please do not consider using this on a live environment without making drastic changes.
It does not limit customers, nor does it limit categories. It does however limit everything on the dashboard, configuration scopes, products, orders, invoices, etc.

I have give my best not to use any rewrites. Unfortunately in some cases due to lack of core support of certain events some anti-patterns were used (instanceof as primary example) to avoid using rewrites (which are nastier).

Instructions:
1) For every limited user, set a website. (Edit the admin user)
2) Make sure that the user enters the admin page through his own specific storeview. Otherwise there will be a nice 404.

Have amazing fun.
